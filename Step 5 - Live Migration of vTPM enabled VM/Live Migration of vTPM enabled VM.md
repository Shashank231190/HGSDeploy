# Live Migration of vTPM enabled VM

When we enable the vTPM on any virtual machine it will create a Key Protector for that VM and that Key protector will be bound with 2 certificates (Signing and Encryption) saved in “Shielded VM Local Certificates”.

If these certificates are missing from the destination Host then VM will fail to Live migrate.

# We can see below errors 

Live migration of 'Virtual Machine 'VMname**' failed.

Virtual machine migration operation for ''VMname**'’ failed at migration destination 'HostName-**'. (Virtual machine ID <GUID>)
The version of the device 'Microsoft Virtual TPM Device' of the virtual machine 'VMname**' is not compatible with device on physical computer 'HostName-**'. (Virtual machine ID <GUID>)

# Resolution

Export the Signing and Encryption certificate with private Key from “Shielded VM Local Certificates” folder from the Hyper-V host where we have created the VM with vTPM feature on the destination server.
 
Command to export Encryption Certificate:
certutil -exportPFX -p "L@m12345" "Shielded VM Local Certificates" 46b405de4ca798804fa40354c6502f1b c:\temp\VMEncryption.pfx
 
Command to export Signing Certificate:
certutil -exportPFX -p "L@m12345" "Shielded VM Local Certificates" 268797c8cbc6c49f4ce2a0e5075efacc c:\temp\VMSigning.pfx

Import both the Signing and Encryption certificate on the Host where you want the VM to be migrated.

C:\certs>certutil -importPFX "Shielded VM Local Certificates" "C:\Certs\ankit-VMEncryption.pfx"

It will ask for password, enter L@m12345 and this will import the certificates.
 
If the certificates are present on the server, then VM will search for its key protector and VM will find the protector and it will boot up without any issue.
